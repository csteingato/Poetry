The Fox and the Girl by Gillian Clarke


Once her father came home with a fox cub
in his coat pocket. Lost in the city,
shivering in rubbish outside the pub,
the colour of conkers and as pretty

as a puppy, its teeth like needles.
It hissed in her arms, but she wheedled
to keep it. When it bit her she cried
for her bloody hand, and she cried

when he said, 'Mae'n wyllt. It's a wild
animal, not a pet for a child.'
She could feel its life, its warm fur,
its quick heart beating against her,

and she hurt for its animal mystery,
for the vanishing story of a girl
and a fox lost for words
in the secret forest.
