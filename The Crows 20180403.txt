The Crows
by Carlye Stein

I scatter seeds and crumbs
so the crows will come,

usually
out of earshot of the cats
for whom turning locks
are loud and urgent 
as the rattle of food.

But the cats will always hear,
take up their posts at the window sill
and begin their indoor watch.

I will stand behind,
rest my hand on restless fur 

as crows descend in murderous streaks
all razor beaks and oily wings,
fanning tails, open claws.

Triumphant hops and angry caws 
give way to glinting things,
grubs recalled with corvid skill 
unequivocal
as the green of verges and lawns undone.

Some crows (maybe one)
may tilt their heads to look,
clever laughter in their eyes
but the cats and I,
our sole replies are feline chatter
and quite awe

and they will know as they depart 
that we are hopeful or
hungry for their return.
