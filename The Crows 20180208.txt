The Crows 
  by Carlye Stein

I scatter seeds and crumbs 
so the crows will come,
usually
out of earshot of the cats 
for whom turning locks are
loud and urgent as the rattle of food.

But the cats will always hear,
take up their posts at the window sill
and begin their indoor watch.
I will stand behind,
rest my hand on restless fur
as crows descend in
murderous streaks
all razor beaks and oily wings, 
fanning tails, curling claws.
They caw and hop
in anger or triumph,
collect or bury all they see:
glinting things or
grubs recalled with corvid skill 
unequivocal
as the green of verges
and lawns undone.

They tilt their heads to look,
clever laughter in their eyes
but the cats and I, 
our sole replies are
feline chatter and quiet awe--

we linger, then withdraw,   
hungry or hopeful for their return.
